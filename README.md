# Cooking Recipes

This is a curated list of simple yet awesome food recipes, gathered during travels, tested again and again, and refined according to my taste *(less sugar)* and healthier up to a certain point.

Feel free to pull request for new recipes as long as you tested them yourself (no blind copying from the internet). I usually cut the sugar in half *(or use only a third)*, and sometimes other natural sweeteners.

> I like to make most of my food from scratch. I also try to only cook with the best and noble ingredients.

I use metric units *(gram, C°, centimeter)* for more precision and accuracy. When I use tablespoon and teaspoon, that means that it's up to you to tune up or down the taste. 

If you have any questions for me, please let me know.
